# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I would say 3/5. I think there are so many different things to do with the each method that I need more time to play around with it.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It was uncomfortable but a good test. I did a lot of googling and trial and error. I tried so many different ways to get the second challenge to work and was struggling a lot. The best help was watching others' videos!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I added practice more with arrays and conditionals. I feel like there are a lot of things to do/play around with. I will be working on these in the next three weeks
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have a questions on why there was two end on the second challenge. I will ask my cohort members.
